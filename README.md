## Risk Analysis

The lack of 3d assets which would depict the products accurately would be problematic. Also, the variabilities of the specifications of users' devices would prove to be a challenge as it will affect the accuracy and tracking of the AR Camera and the scaling of the 3d object. The potential customers need to be technologically aware of modern technology so it will be easier for them to use the augmented reality feature. However, it will not limit the user's capacity to browse the online shop.

## Describe the Possible Solutions

### 1. An Augmented Reality Furniture Product Viewer for Online Furniture Shop

The FurniShop AR was made to provide a convenient purchasing experience for potential customers of furniture with a 3d experience. FurniShop utilizes different 3d sources and integrates GL Transmission Format Binary File (glb) assets. It has a manual to make it easier for new customers to use this feature. It was built with buttons to manipulate and view 3d models in the surroundings using the smartphone camera. The following buttons below are created with different functions:

- View in AR button – to access the product viewer.
- Lock button – to lock the position of the furniture and avoid extra movement.
- Left-Right buttons – to rotate the model.
- Stop button – to stop the AR experience after viewing the product.

### 2. A Virtual Reality Furniture Product Viewer for Online Furniture Shop

A virtual reality product viewer for an online shop is a product viewer that uses equipment like a VR headset and a device with a gyroscope to transform furniture display with a 360-degree interaction. This product viewer uses 2D images to enable the customers to view the furniture in 3D in their real-life environment by adding scales and depth to the 2D static furniture images.

### 3. A Gamified Furniture Product Viewer for Online Furniture Shop

A gamified product viewer uses a platform like rewards, points, games, and incentives, enabling the sellers to promote their furniture by social sharing. This furniture product viewer will allow customers to interact in a game where they can get coupons and rewards that they can use to lessen the cost of the furniture that they want to buy.

## Evaluation Criteria

Choosing the best product viewer considered the following criteria:

### 1.	Relevance
People usually buys their products online since it is convenient and will not consume much time. Customers often wonder what the sizes of the actual volume of the product they bought online are. FurniShop AR is developed to address this kind of issue. Besides, this product viewer will be essential to determining the perfect choice of furniture. Also, it will lessen the chance of choosing the wrong furniture sizes and help the shopping website to lessen possible product returns.

### 2. Effectiveness and Accuracy
Online Shopping websites use images and product information of the furniture they sell online. However, after selling the product, some sellers receive negative feedback from the customers because customers mostly misinterpret the actual size or appearance of the product they bought. A product viewer should effectively address these misconceptions about the furniture product sizes and help the shop present its product accurately.

### 3.	User Experience 									
Images are not enough to determine whether what you see online is real. Some customers have trust issues regarding online products since they cannot physically see them. Product viewers should ensure that the online shopping website visitors will have a great experience. The 3d feature of the product viewer will be a great advantage in attracting more customers.

### 4. Navigation and Design
People tend to use user-friendly shopping websites set up so they can easily shop online. The product viewer is designed to help customers to navigate the product quickly. Also, some buttons will serve as a guide for the customers to access the 3d experience easily. 

### 5. Cost
A product viewer should be affordable and help online sellers promote their products without spending their money. Besides, the system should also consider the small business to help them promote their products at less cost.

### 6. Maintainability
A furniture product viewer should be easy to maintain, and the system should be easily repaired if there are some troubles that the sellers and buyers will experience while using it.

## Propose with the Feasible Solution

| EVALUATION CRITERIA | AUGMENTED REALITY FURNITURE PRODUCT VIEWER | VIRTUAL REALITY FURNITURE PRODUCT VIEWER | GAMIFIED FURNITURE PRODUCT VIEWER |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Relevance | 10 | 10 | 9 |
| Effectiveness and Accuracy | 9 | 9 | 9 |
| User Experience | 10 | 10 | 10 |
| Navigation and Design | 9 | 10 | 8 |
| Cost | 9 | 7 | 8 |
| Maintainability | 9 | 8 | 8 |
| Average Score | 9.33 | 9 | 8.67 |


The evaluation criteria used in assessing the most feasible solution considered the following factors: relevance, effectiveness and accuracy, user experience, navigation and design, cost, and maintainability. We assessed each factor by giving a scale of 1-10 to know the most feasible solution. Each factor was graded, and the table showed that the Augmented Reality Furniture Product Viewer is the most feasible solution for having an average mean score of 9.33, compared to virtual reality furniture product viewer with a mean score of 9 and gamified furniture product viewer with a mean score of 8.67. This implies that an augmented reality product viewer is best for promoting furniture products.

As a result of this project, developing the augmented reality product viewer will significantly help promote local furniture products from different areas. Also, it will not cost much for the seller to spend much money maintaining the product viewer with the 3d feature on their site. The product viewer will not need a monthly payment to access the 3d feature; this is the best way to promote the furniture product without renting an apartment to sell the furniture. Besides, the customers will also benefit since they will no longer need to spend money visiting the shop. It only means that fuel consumption will lessen, which is a significant indicator of avoiding extra costs. On the other hand, FurniShop AR, a product viewer, is software that can be accessed using smartphones. It will be an edge for the system to be accessible.


## Conclusion 

This project aims to develop a product viewer that will address the product misconceptions, negative feedback, and negative buying experience that affects both the customers and seller. The product development considered the four criteria: relevance, effectiveness and accuracy, user experience, navigation and design, cost, and maintainability. These criteria are utilized to determine which product viewer will most effectively address furniture online selling problems. Also, this was to improve the technological and economic aspect of promoting local furniture brands. This project concluded that Augmented Reality Furniture Product Viewer is the most feasible solution that will significantly impact promoting and selling local furniture products by accessing its factor when it comes to its relevance, effectiveness and accuracy, user experience, navigation and design, cost, and maintainability.
